This script enables Ada to give water to a person. First, a glass in the environment is detected and localized using April Tags. Then, the robot grasps the glass using TSRs, moves it to a sequence of pre-determined configurations, so that the human user can drink water from the glass, and then places the glass back to a pre-defined location.
